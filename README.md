SPSProcessor
============

Scripts for finding pattern in SPS profiles in a large dataset. Currently still experimenting with data mining algorithms.

Running
=======

1) Place a set of test profiles in the folder '../profiles' with the extension ".prof" or extract the sample data set using 'unzip -d ../profiles sample_data.zip'.
   Note that the first run with a new data set will be slower since the profile will need to be cached.

2) run test.sh.
